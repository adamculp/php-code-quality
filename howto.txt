This container does nothing when invoking it without a command.

Usage example:
$ docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/app -w /app adamculp/php-code-quality:latest <your-command-with-arguments>

In the example above, the mounted host directory is your current working directory.
This is the most common case, because it enables you to run the php tools on everything in
and below that directory.

There are two ways it can be used:

* Run a command in the container on your mounted directory or below.
* Run a script from your mounted directory or below.

Available commands in the container:

* php
* composer

* phpunit

* phpcs
* phpmd
* phpcpd
* phan

* phpcbf
* php-cs-fixer

* sh (or any other command)
